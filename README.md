## Hi there 👋
I'm Kenneth Robinson-Neal 

I am a **Computer Science** student at **Maestro College** focused on building high-performance systems and scalable software. My background as an **AI Trainer** and **Code Quality Analyst** has instilled a rigorous standard for "production-ready" code, ensuring that every project I develop is optimized for logic and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
* **Systems Programming:** Deep diving into memory management and resource optimization using **C++**.
* **Enterprise Architecture:** Implementing robust, modular design patterns with **Java**.
* **Agentic AI Systems:** Leveraging **Python** and **Claude AI** to build automated, intelligent workflows, specifically in **transcript review agentic coding**.

## 🚀 Professional Workflow
I track my technical growth and current coding sprints through my **[Portfolio Development Roadmap](https://github.com/users/principerayquez21-stack/projects/2)**.

### Current Sprints:
* **In Progress:** C++ Advanced Memory Management System
* **Todo:** Java Object-Oriented Design Patterns Library
* **Todo:** Python Agentic Transcript Reviewer

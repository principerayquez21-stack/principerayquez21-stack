## Hi there 👋
I'm Kenneth Robinson-Neal 

I am a **Computer Science** student at **Maestro College** focused on building high-performance systems and scalable software. My background as an **AI Trainer** and **Code Quality Analyst** has instilled a rigorous standard for "production-ready" code, ensuring that every project I develop is optimized for logic and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
* **Systems Programming:** Deep diving into memory management and resource optimization using **C++**.
* **Enterprise Architecture:** Implementing robust, modular design patterns with **Java**.

* **Agentic AI Systems:** Leveraging **Python** and **Claude AI** to build automated, intelligent workflows, specifically in **transcript review agentic coding**.
